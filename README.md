# Llama 3 Function Calling 
# AI Assistant API with Streamlit Interface

## Overview
This project consists of two main components: a Flask-based API and a Streamlit web interface. The Flask API serves as an AI Assistant, handling queries such as answering questions, managing a virtual to-do list, and performing simple arithmetic operations. The Streamlit interface provides a user-friendly front end to interact with the AI Assistant, allowing users to input queries and manage their to-do lists directly through the web.

## Features
- **AI Assistant**: Answers user queries and performs tasks based on simple predefined rules.
- **To-Do List Management**: Allows users to add, view, and remove tasks from a virtual to-do list.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: A Streamlit-based web interface that makes it easy to interact with the AI Assistant and manage tasks.
